Description: Maximum likelihood estimation for stochastic frontier analysis 
    (SFA) of production (profit) and cost functions. The package includes the 
    basic stochastic frontier for cross-sectional or pooled data with several 
    distributions for the one-sided error term (i.e., Rayleigh, gamma, Weibull, 
    lognormal, uniform, generalized exponential and truncated skewed Laplace), 
    the latent class stochastic frontier model (LCM) as described in Dakpo et al. (2021) 
    <doi:10.1111/1477-9552.12422>, for cross-sectional and pooled data, and the 
    sample selection model as described in Greene (2010) <doi:10.1007/s11123-009-0159-1>, 
    and applied in Dakpo et al. (2021) <doi:10.1111/agec.12683>.
    Several possibilities in terms of optimization algorithms are proposed.
