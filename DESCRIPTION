Description: Maximum likelihood estimation for stochastic frontier
    analysis (SFA) of production (profit) and cost functions. The package
    includes the basic stochastic frontier for cross-sectional or pooled
    data with several distributions for the one-sided error term (i.e.,
    Rayleigh, gamma, Weibull, lognormal, uniform, generalized exponential
    and truncated skewed Laplace), the latent class stochastic frontier
    model (LCM) as described in Dakpo et al. (2021)
    <doi:10.1111/1477-9552.12422>, for cross-sectional and pooled data,
    and the sample selection model as described in Greene (2010)
    <doi:10.1007/s11123-009-0159-1>, and applied in Dakpo et al. (2021)
    <doi:10.1111/agec.12683>.  Several possibilities in terms of
    optimization algorithms are proposed.
