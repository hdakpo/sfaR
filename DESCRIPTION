Description: Maximum likelihood estimation for stochastic frontier analysis 
    (SFA) of production (profit) and cost functions. The package includes 
    several distributions for the one-sided error term (i.e. Rayleigh, 
    Gamma, Weibull, lognormal, uniform, generalized exponential and 
    truncated skewed Laplace) as well as the latent class stochastic frontier 
    model (LCM) as described in Dakpo et al. (2021) 
    <doi:10.1111/1477-9552.12422>. Several possibilities in terms of 
    optimization algorithms are proposed.
