Description: Maximum likelihood estimation for stochastic frontier analysis 
    (SFA) of production (profit) and cost functions. The package includes 
    several distributions for the one-sided error term (i.e. Rayleigh, 
    Gamma, Weibull, lognormal, uniform, generalized exponential and 
    truncated skewed Laplace) the latent class stochastic frontier 
    model (LCM) as described in Dakpo et al. (2021) 
    <doi:10.1111/1477-9552.12422>, the sample selection model used in 
    Dakpo et al. (2021) <doi:10.1111/agec.12683> as well as the zero inefficiency
    stochastic frontier model (ZISF) proposed by Kumbhakar al. (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2012.08.021>.
    Several possibilities in terms of optimization algorithms are proposed.
