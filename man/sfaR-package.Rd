\title{sfaR: A package for estimating stochastic frontier models}
\description{
The \pkg{sfaR} package provides a set of tools (maximum likelihood - ML and
maximum simulated likelihood - MSL) for various specifications of stochastic
frontier analysis (SFA).
}
\details{
Seven categories of functions are available: \code{\link{sfacross}},
\code{\link{sfalcmcross}}, \code{\link{sfagzisfcross}},
\code{\link{sfacnsfcross}}, \code{\link{sfamisfcross}},
\code{\link{sfazisfcross}}, \code{\link{sfaselectioncross}},
which estimate different types of frontiers and offer eleven alternative
optimization algorithms (i.e., "bfgs", "bhhh", "nr", "nm", "cg", "sann",
"ucminf", "mla", "sr1", "sparse", "nlminb").

\section{sfacross}{
 \code{\link{sfacross}} estimates the basic stochastic
frontier analysis (SFA) for cross-sectional or pooled data and allows for
ten different distributions for the one-sided error term. These distributions
include the exponential, the gamma, the generalized exponential,
the half normal, the lognormal, the truncated normal, the truncated skewed
Laplace, the Rayleigh, the uniform, and the Weibull distributions.
In the case of the gamma, lognormal, and Weibull distributions, maximum
simulated likelihood (MSL) is used with eight possibilities for generating
random numbers: halton, generalized halton, sobol, randomized sobol,
modified latin hypercube sampling, richtmyer, randomized richtmyer, and
uniform. Heteroscedasticity in both error terms can be implemented, in
addition to heterogeneity in the truncated mean parameter in the case of the
truncated normal and lognormal distributions. In addition, in the case of the
truncated normal distribution, the scaling property can be
estimated.
}

\section{sfalcmcross}{
 \code{\link{sfalcmcross}} estimates latent class
stochastic frontier models (LCM) for cross-sectional or pooled data.
It accounts for technological heterogeneity by splitting the observations
into a maximum number of five classes. The classification operates based on
a logit functional form that can be specified using some covariates (namely,
the separating variables allowing the separation of observations in several
classes). Only the half normal distribution is available for the one-sided
error term. Heteroscedasticity in both error terms is possible. The choice of
the number of classes can be guided by several information criteria (i.e.,
AIC, BIC, or HQIC).
}

\section{sfacnsfcross}{
 \code{\link{sfacnsfcross}} estimates the contaminated
noise stochastic frontier (CNSF), which allows for the possibility of
outliers in the two-sided error term. The model splits the observations into
two groups with different variance for the two-sided error term. The
probability of belonging to one of these classes is based on either a logit,
probit, cauchit or cloglog functional form that can be specified using some
covariates. As in the case of \code{\link{sfacross}} ten different
distributions for the one-sided error term are implemented. These
distributions include the exponential, the Gamma, the generalized exponential,
the half normal, the lognormal, the truncated normal, the truncated skewed
Laplace, the Rayleigh, the uniform and the Weibull distributions. In the case
of the Gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions, maximum simulated
likelihood (MSL) is used with eight possibilities for generating random
numbers: halton, generalized halton, sobol, randomized sobol, modified latin
hypercube sampling, richtmyer, randomized richtmyer, and uniform.
Heteroscedasticity in both error terms can be implemented, in addition to
heterogeneity in the truncated mean parameter in the case of the truncated
normal and lognormal distributions. Two variants of the CNSF are available:
one that allows common one-sided error term variance for both classes and the
other one that allows different one-sided error term variances between the
two aforementionned classes.

\section{sfamisfcross}{
 \code{\link{sfamisfcross}} estimates the multi-modal
inefficiency stochastic frontier (MISF), which allows for mixture
distribution in the one-sided error term. The model splits the observations
into two groups with different variance for the one-sided error term.
The probability of belonging to one of these classes is based on either a
logit, probit, cauchit or cloglog functional form that can be specified using
some covariates. As in the case of \code{\link{sfacross}} ten different
distributions for the one-sided error term are implemented. These
distributions include the exponential, the Gamma, the generalized
exponential, the half normal, the lognormal, the truncated normal, the
truncated skewed Laplace, the Rayleigh, the uniform and the Weibull
distributions. In the case of the Gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions,
maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) is used with eight possibilities for
generating random numbers: halton, generalized halton, sobol, randomized
sobol, modified latin hypercube sampling, richtmyer, randomized richtmyer,
and uniform. Heteroscedasticity in both error terms can be implemented, in
addition to heterogeneity in the truncated mean parameter in the case of the
truncated normal and lognormal distributions.
}

\section{sfazisfcross}{
 \code{\link{sfazisfcross}} relaxes the assumption that
all firms are inefficient (zero inefficiency stochastic frontier - ZISF).
The model splits the observations into two groups: one efficient and the
other inefficient. The probability of belonging to one of these classes is
based on either a logit, probit, cauchit or cloglog functional form that can
be specified using some covariates. As in the case of \code{\link{sfacross}}
ten different distributions for the one-sided error term are implemented.
These distributions include the exponential, the Gamma, the generalized
exponential, the half normal, the lognormal, the truncated normal, the
truncated skewed Laplace, the Rayleigh, the uniform and the Weibull
distributions. In the case of the Gamma, lognormal and Weibull
distributions, maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) is used with eight
possibilities for generating random numbers: halton, generalized halton,
sobol, randomized sobol, modified latin hypercube sampling, richtmyer,
randomized richtmyer, and uniform. Heteroscedasticity in both error terms
can be implemented, in addition to heterogeneity in the truncated mean
parameter in the case of the truncated normal and lognormal distributions.
Two variants of the ZISF are available: one that allows common two-sided
error term variance for both classes (inefficient vs efficient) and the
other one that allows different two-sided error term variances between the
two aforementionned classes.

\section{sfagzisfcross}{
 \code{\link{sfagzisfcross}} estimates the generalized
zero inefficiency stochastic frontier model (GZISF) for cross-sectional or
pooled data. It accounts for technological heterogeneity by splitting the
observations into a maximum number of five classes, with the particularity
that the last class is contains efficient observations. The classification
operates based on a logit functional form that can be specified using some
covariates (namely, the separating variables allowing the separation of
observations in several classes). Only the half normal distribution is
available for the one-sided error term. Heteroscedasticity in both error
terms is possible. The choice of the number of classes can be guided by
several information criteria (i.e., AIC, BIC, or HQIC).

\section{sfametacross}{
 \code{\link{sfametacross}} estimates either the
deterministic or the stochastic metafrontier.
}

\section{sfaselectioncross}{
 \code{\link{sfaselectioncross}} estimates the
frontier for cross-sectional or pooled data in the presence of sample
selection. The model solves the selection bias due to the correlation
between the two-sided error terms in both the selection and the frontier
equations. The likelihood can be estimated using five different
possibilities: gauss-kronrod quadrature, adaptive integration over hypercubes
(hcubature and pcubature), gauss-hermite quadrature, and maximum simulated
likelihood. Only the half normal
distribution is available for the one-sided error term. Heteroscedasticity
in both error terms is possible.
