\title{sfaR: An R package for estimating stochastic frontier models}

\description{The \pkg{sfaR} package provides a set of tools (maximum likelihood -
ML and maximum simulated likelihood - MSL) for various specifications of
stochastic frontier analysis (SFA).

Two categories of important functions are available:
\code{\link{sfacross}} and \code{\link{lcmcross}}, which estimate different
types of frontiers and offer nine alternative optimization algorithms
(i.e. "bfgs", "bhhh", "nr", "nm", "ucminf", "mla", "sr1", "sparse" and
"nlminb").}

\section{lcmcross}{
\code{\link{lcmcross}} estimates latent class stochastic frontier models (LCM), 
which accounts for technological heterogeneity by splitting the observations into a
maximum number of five classes. The classification operates based on a logit
functional form that can be specified using some covariates (namely, the separating 
variables allowing the separation of observations in several classes). Only the half
normal distribution is available for the one-sided error term. Heteroscedasticity 
in both error terms is possible. The choice of the number of classes can be guided 
by several information criteria (i.e. AIC, BIC or HQIC).
}

\section{sfacross}{
\code{\link{sfacross}} estimates the frontier for cross-sectional data
and allows for ten different distributions for the one-sided error term.
These distributions include the exponential, the Gamma, the generalized
exponential, the half normal, the lognormal, the truncated normal, the
truncated skewed Laplace, the Rayleigh, the uniform and the Weibull distributions. 
In the case of the Gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions, maximum simulated
likelihood (MSL) is used with the possibility of four specific distributions to
construct the draws: Halton, Generalized Halton, Sobol and uniform.
Heteroscedasticity in both error terms can be implemented, in addition to
heterogeneity in the truncated mean parameter in the case of the truncated
normal and lognormal distributions. In addition, in the case of the truncated normal
distribution, the scaling property can be estimated.
