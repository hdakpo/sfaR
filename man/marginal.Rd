\title{Compute marginal effects of the inefficiency drivers in classic or latent class stochastic models}

\description{
This function returns marginal effects of the inefficiency drivers 
from classic or latent class stochastic frontier models estimated with
\code{\link{sfacross}} or \code{\link{lcmcross}.}
}

\usage{
\method{marginal}{sfacross}(object, ...)

\method{marginal}{lcmcross}(object, ...)
}

\arguments{
\item{object}{A classic or latent class stochastic frontier model returned 
by \code{\link{sfacross}} or \code{\link{lcmcross}}.}

\item{...}{Currently ignored.}
}

\details{
\code{\link{marginal}} operates in the presence of exogenous variables that 
explain inefficiency, namely the inefficiency drivers (\eqn{uhet = ~ Z_u} or \eqn{muhet = ~
 Z_{mu}}).

Two components are computed for each variable: the marginal effects on the
expected inefficiency (\eqn{\frac{\partial E[u]}{\partial Z_{(m)u}}}) and the
marginal effects on the variance of inefficiency (\eqn{\frac{\partial
  V[u]}{\partial Z_{(m)u}}}).

The model also allows the Wang (2002) parametrization of
\eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\sigma_u^2} by the same vector of exogenous variables.
This double parameterization accounts for non-monotonic relationships
between the inefficiency and its drivers.
}

\value{
\code{\link{marginal}} returns a data frame containing the marginal effects of the \eqn{Z_u} variables
on the expected inefficiency (each variable has the prefix \code{"Eu_"})
and on the variance of the inefficiency (each variable has the prefix
\code{"Vu_"}) is returned.

In the case of the latent class model (LCM), each variable terminates with 
\code{"_c#"} where \code{"#"} is the class number.
